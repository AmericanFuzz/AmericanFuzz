- 👋 Good day, I’m @AmericanFuzz
- 👀 I’m interested in: Quite too many things to summarize, but mostly making machines to defend what I love.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Nothing, anything, and all the yet, everything.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Whatever I might not understand, or am struggling with, or am good at.
- 📫 How to reach me: with your hand, if you have a good wingspan, you will reach me. Otherwise, use one of those telescopic back scratchers at those souvenier shops.

- Thank your for reading all of that!
- If you didn't, please do. It's funny. I promise.
